  <h2>For the Beginner Dev Who Resents All the Cat Love..</h2>
    <p>If you're like me, you're noticing an excess of cat and kitten references during your lessons. Now, <strong>DON'T GET ME WRONG</strong> I like kitties as much as the next human with a soul..</p>
  <h3>But if I may be so bold..</h3>
    <p>Why not take this opportunity to spread some awareness? Kitties are doing fine.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They're adopted more often than their older counterparts</li>
      <li>They ruin furniture and customize clothing with reckless abandon</li>
      <li>You love them, even as their tiny pincers gouge into your skin</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>It's all very adorable, I know...</em> But what if you're more of a dog person?</p>
