    <h1>These are some of my old notes </h1>

    <p>A positron emission tomography <strong>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography">PET</a>)</strong> scan is a type of imaging test that uses <em>radioactive tracer</em> to look for abnormalities in tissues and organs. 
    The machine detects pairs of <em>gamma rays</em> emitted indirectly by <em>positron-emitting</em> radioactive materials. By monitoring the metabolic processes in the body, a <em>colorful</em> three dimensional image is produced. Many radioactive tracers are used in <strong>PET</strong> to image selective tissue due to specificity metabolism of each tissue. </p>

    <p> <strong>PET</strong> scan is heavily used in clinical oncology for imaging of tumors, and in neurology for brain activity. <strong>PET</strong> scan also show problems at the cellular level. Targeting disease such as coronary artery disease, brain tumors, memory disorders, and seizures. </p>
      
      <p> Define <strong>melanoma</strong> and how it differs from <em>squamous</em> and <em>basal cell cancers</em>. </p>
      <ul> <p> Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanoma exists between the epidermis and the dermis. Can be cured if found before spreading to blood vessels. No blood vessels at the epidermis. Usually at the skin </p>
        <li>Squamous cell carcinoma, main cell of the epidermis </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Various tissues, lips mouth, esophagus, lining of digestive tract, lungs, </li>
            <li>Relatively slow growth rate</li>
            <li>2nd most common type of cancer</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Basal cell carcinoma</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Most common type of cancer</li>
