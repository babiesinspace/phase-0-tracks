# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Samantha  ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# the difference between require_relative vs require is that 
# require_relative allows you access a file using the relative path to the root 
# and adds a file that's already been installed.

#=======================================================================
# Reflection Section

#What are the differences between the two different hash 
#syntaxes shown in the state_data file?

#Syntactic sugar was used for the state-specific hash, where as a hash rocket was used in the hashy-hash
#What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
# Require relative points to a file through it's relative path vs. relative would uploads a file from an installed area of Ruby (or some downloaded plug-in/attachment)
#What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
#You can iterate through each element by key or value
#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the 
#variables, if anything?
#It's hard to know when you can assign a variable (and that variables scope) to the return of a method
#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
#Knowing the areas I probably need more work in..
