- Check out General Assembly Dash Tutorial to review what they had on jQuery
- Codecademy (hey, not JUST them)
- Research for good resources
- w3schools?
- At least every 30 min stop and code 
- JSFiddle?

I forgot to stop and code. I just got sucked into the General Assembly lesson and worked until I finished. 

In the future, find a way to get my attention away from what I'm doing. (Some kind of alarm must be needed, as I never remember to stop and take a break)

I enjoy interactive tutorials. Codecademy and GenAssembly have slides that one must work through. I like to learn from action. I also like to learn from teaching or explaining. I should try to find a way to incorporate this second bit to really hammer the points in. (Perhaps I can use my "break" that I never take to try to explain to someone who's never coded before what it is that I'm doing? Some imaginary person.. Cause that's not weird or anything..)
